/**
 * The page each PDF was last left open at, so that it opens there next time. Issue #25.
 *
 * Kept against what the file holds rather than where it came from. One document reaches
 * the viewer under a different URI from the picker, from a granted folder and from a file
 * manager's "Open with", and an attachment handed over by a mail or chat app often arrives
 * on a URI that will not exist tomorrow. A key read from the bytes is the same down every
 * one of those routes, survives the file being renamed or moved, and tells anyone reading
 * this store nothing about what the file is called or where it lives.
 *
 * Two copies of one file therefore share a page, which is the right answer, and a file
 * saved again with changes in it starts from the top, which is a defensible one.
 *
 * Held in the no-backup folder, which is why this is a file of its own and not a
 * preferences file: Android decides where those go, and it is not there. That folder is
 * the one part of an app's storage the backup framework always leaves out, cloud backup and
 * phone-to-phone transfer alike, whatever the manifest asks for. The manifest alone would
 * only be half of that. allowBackup="false" closes the cloud backup, but from Android 12 a
 * transfer to a new phone can still carry everything else, preferences included. Where
 * somebody was in a book stays on the phone they were reading it on.
 *
 * One line per document: the key, the page, and when it was left there, the last only so
 * the oldest entry can be dropped once there are [MAX] of them.
